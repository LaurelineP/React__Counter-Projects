# React Counters and TypeScript
## TypeScript ?
```
TypeScript is the missing part of JavaScript.
```
As we know JavaScript is poorly typed, right ? Here intervain TypeScript.  
It is for those working in an scalable environment and would like to :  
- get feedbacks from your code as you're typing
- get suggestions from your code as you're typing
- write better documentation



## :pushpin: Organisation
- TypeScript:
    - from scratch: ```npx create-react-app hello-tsx --typescript```
    - w/ CRA: ```npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest```
        - modify you extension file with **.ts** or **.tsx**
    - without CRA: ```npm install --save-dev typescript awesome-typescript-loader```
