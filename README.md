# React Counters
## :blue_book: What this is all about?
```
As I add days into my developper starting carreer calendar,  
I noticed that at every developpers' steps we oftenly encounters todos and counters apps:  
in tutos, docs, examples and we have to admit those are good examples to test new things.
```

Instead of recreating each time a counter or a todo app to test different tools I decided to  
use the same base project and test in separated branches the tools I want to explore.  
These WIP repos are **all about exploring and making new things** with todos or counters examples such as:  
- testing frameworks, libraries, and more ...
- exploring/practicing new tools.  

*Currently available: only this **React Counter** repo*

## :black_nib: Organisation

All tools I'll be testing will be organised into **seperated branches**:  
so if you'd like to check those you'll find branches named by their tools' name  
and all wip branch or done branches will be listed down below.  
Good to know:  
* In each one I might keep note on README.md  
* Master will be my counter boilerplate with react.
